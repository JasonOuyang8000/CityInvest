## Summary
The game is about investing in buildings (resource collecting buildings and money-making buildings) for gaining money.It takes place in the middle of nowhere but the land is filled with rich resources! You need to reach a specified amount of money in a specfic time. To start off, the User is given a small grid of land and some small amount of resources. (Steel, Minerals, and Wood) They can then use those resources to build a few resource collecting buildings. The user can then decide to use those resources to further build more resource collecting buildings or decide sell those resources in the market for money. Initially, the resources the user sells in the market is worth a lot of money but then decreases in value as they sell more of it. If the user has money, the user can decide to buy money making resources instead of relying on farming resources for money. Money making resources offer more money but they can lose money as well. I got this idea from civilizations game and farmville.  

## Structure of game


### Land and Placing Buildings
User is given a plot of land. There will be empty grids on the land which the user can click to see what buildings are available to build. A menu will pop out with a list of buildings. User can then click on a building thats avaible to be placed in the plot. If it's gray colored, it's not available yet. If there's color, it's available. It will then be shown and occupied on the grid. If the grid is not empty or is occupied, user can click on it to sell it for siginficantly reduced price. It will then be gone from the screen.

### Resources Bar
There will be a resources bar on the screen which shows all the resources that the User has accumulated. This includes
resources such as money, steel, minerals, wood, and crypto. 

### Resource Collecting Buildings
Resource collecting buildings are buildings that collect resources for the user such as steel, minerals,and wood. They can only be created in an empty grid of land.It would cost resources to build resource collecting building. They should
collect a amount per second which is then displayed in the Resources bar screen. There will be a refinary building(steel), mining building (minerals), and woodcutting farm (wood). Resource collecting buildings CANNOT BE SOLD.

### Resources
There will be 4 types of resources the user can collect. They are steel, minerals and wood in resource collecting buildings and crypto made in crypto mine. Each resource is tradeable for an amount of gold in the market.

### Money Making Buildings
Money making buildings are good at making money and could only be bought with money. They can only be built where there is an empty grid of land. For now, there are three types of money making buildings. All money making buildings share a risk of making the user lose money. One is a fast-food diner(low-risk low-reward). Another one is a crypto mine(medium-risk medium-reward). The last one is a crypto investment corp(high-risk high-reward). Any of these buildings can be sold in any given time frame. 

### Market
Market is a menu option in the screen which allows the user to sell some of their resources. Selling a resource takes time and only two can be sold at a given time. After a given time, the user will be a collect a specified amount of money. Wood, minerals, and steel initally sells high but drops in value as more are sold. Crpyto prices fluctuate in prices very often. 

## Goal
1. Create a land grid with 4 plots of land. User can buy buildings when clicked on the plot. (occupied/not occupied).
2. Have a Buy Buildings Menu Modal. A minimum of 3 resource making buildings and one gold making buildings for user to choose. (random risk alogrithm for how the gold is gained)
3. Have a Global Time.
4. Have a Market Menu Modal. (Algorithm to set diminish prices) Allows User to sell/buy a specified resource for gold (vice versa). Sets a timer after every buy/sell to prevent user from buying/selling.
5. Have a reset option.
6. Hae a stats modal at the every end to show how well you did, and if you win or lose.

## Stretch Goals 
1. Allow user to buy more plots of land.
2. Have more resource buildings and gold making buildings to make game more interesting. (More random risk algorithms for how gold is gained)
3. Buildings once placed can finally be sold for gold. (Except for resource ones) 
4. Find a better strategy to make the game more fun 
5. Replace current visual buildings with Isometric graphics. Make the game more visually appealing.

## Summary
    The game is about investing in buildings (resource collecting buildings and money-making buildings) for gaining gold. You need to reach a specified amount of gold in a specfic time. To start off, the User is given a small grid of land and some small amount of resources. (Steel, Minerals, and Wood) They can then use those resources to build a few resource collecting buildings. The user can then decide to use those resources to further build more resource collecting buildings or decide sell those resources in the market for gold. Initially, the resources the user sells in the market is worth a lot of gold but then decreases in value as they sell more of it. If the user has gold, the user can decide to buy money making resources instead of relying on farming resources for gold. Money making resources offer more gold but they can lose money as well. I got this idea from civilizations game and farmville.
